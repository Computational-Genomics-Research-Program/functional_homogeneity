# Data repository for [Limits to a classic paradigm: Most transcription factors regulate genes in multiple biological processes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/28/479857.article-info?fbclid=IwAR3srQlqvJ73lQ3jzrKGwKo1Rcwqkb4Ss_J9KVuoed-D1lrZVdT5WHjE_58)
Data is separated in 4 parts:
1. Connectivity analysis. Includes the pipeline used to quantify connectivity for all group of genes.
2. GO analysis. Includes the pipeline to identify dominant GO terms excluding levels 1 and 2 of the ontology, for all groups of genes.
3. Coexpression analysis. Includes the pipeline used to calculate the Spearman correlation of all the groups of genes.
4. Original data sets. Includes the pipeline used to 

## connectivity ##
Includes all the connectivity results reported in the article and the pipeline used to generate them.

## coexpression_analysis ##
Includes all the coexpression results reported in the article, based on the Spearman correlation between pairs of genes. It also includes the pipeline used to generate them.

## GO_analysis ##
Includes the dominant GO terms of all groups reported in the article. Both with and without levels 1 and 2 of the ontology.  It also includes the pipeline used to generate them.

## original_data_sets ##
Includes the genes belonging to all regulons reported in the paper. It also includes the scripts used to generate them.
