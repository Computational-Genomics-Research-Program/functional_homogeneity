## go_results ##
Results for real sets of regulatory groups. Analysis excludes levels 1 and 2 of the ontology.

## go_results_all_levels ##
Results for general regulons including levels 1 and 2 of the ontology.

Sets of randomized genes for each regulatory group. They differ from connectivity random groups in that number of genes in each group is preserved, as opposed to number of enzymes.
